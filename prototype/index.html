          The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities
          in the United States. It is characterized by student-run organizations
          and affiliation groups that support social, academic, athletic, and
          religious activities and interests. Some of the services offered by
          the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and
          fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer
          tutoring, student government association, student support programs
          including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, a
          student-run newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life. The proximity
          of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock enables students
          to take advantage of a wide array of recreational, entertainment,
          educational, internship, and employment opportunities that are not
          available anywhere else in Arkansas.[20]

          There are endless opportunities when you attend college in the capital
          city. From networking with leaders and participating in internships,
          to having outdoor adventures and making lifelong connections, you
          really can have it all in Little Rock. <cite>https://ualr.edu/</cite>

        <h4>Campus living</h4>
        <p>
          UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for
          students ranging from traditional resident rooms to multiple-bedroom
          apartments. The university has four residence halls on the eastern
          side of the campus and the University Village Apartment Complex[21] on
          the southern side of campus. Six learning communities focusing on
          criminal justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future
          business innovators, nursing careers, and STEM are available to
          students.
        </p>

        <h4>Athletics</h4>
        <p>
          UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock
          Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt
          Conference.
          <strong
            >Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor
            football</strong
          >
          (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football
          team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little
          Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center.
        </p>

        <h5>UA Little Rock offers the following sports:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Baseball</li>

          women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and
          wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors.
          Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the
          first Division I program in Arkansas.
        </p>
